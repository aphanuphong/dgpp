//            for the bus's lifetime), src/dst device buffers, elems, the
//            cell pointer, the deadline;

//            staging row (gen-1)%kBusMaxGraphStageRing and its exit

// ---- segment-quantized reduce-scatter/allgather (the prefill class) ------
//
// DESIGN §6.3: large boundaries flow as reduce-scatter + allgather over
// the bulk pool (one-shot's (W-1)x replication is wire-optimal only at
// W=2; RS+AG pays 2(W-1)/W). The buffer is striped on the bulk-slot grid
// (stripe = one bulk slot); shards are contiguous stripe ranges per rank
// (ceil split); the machine processes SEGMENTS of at most
// bulk_slots x lanes stripes so one kernel launch and one flight step
// cover a bounded staging/posting/claiming wave within the pool depths.
//
// Both phases share one sub-range table — each rank's owned stripes of
// the current segment: RS stages every peer's sub-range TO that peer
// (from my src) and folds MY sub-range from all peers' arrivals;
// AG broadcasts MY (now reduced) sub-range to every peer and copies each
// peer's arrivals into dst. The RS fold is the canonical ascending-rank
// fp32 chain per element — bitwise identical to the latency one-shot
// chain, so both paths against one oracle must agree exactly.
//
// Arrival identification (no engine coupling): the sender posts a
// sub-range's stripes in order, striped round-robin over lanes (stripe k
// on lane k%lanes, ring-FIFO per lane); RC delivers in order per lane, so
// the j-th arrival on a lane sits in ring slot j%depth with
// seq = j/depth + 1 — the kernel derives j from the doorbell cell itself
// and maps it to stripe k = i*lanes + lane (i = the in-segment per-lane
// index, from the per-(peer,lane) base the kernel computes by summing
// its OWN ack cells at launch; its acks are the only writer).
//
// Two invariants the mapping forces, both measured into existence:
//   * SEGMENT WINDOW: the rings are flight- and phase-agnostic FIFOs and
//     ranks do not progress in lockstep (shard geometry sees to that), so
//     a receiver's active kernel WILL see future-segment/future-phase
//     doorbells in its cells. It claims only its own window —
//     [base, base + the lane's stripe share) — and leaves the rest
//     unconsumed for the kernel whose window contains them; every post
//     maps to exactly one window of the receiving flight, in ring order,
//     at any skew. Eager claiming acks foreign doorbells away and
//     deadlocks both phases on the loss.
//   * DEFERRED ACKS: the ack certifies the payload CONSUMED — the consume
//     pass after the claims (the RS fold, the AG landing copy) reads the
//     slots, so the ack flushes after it. An ack at claim time returns
//     the sender's credit early and a sender a segment ahead overwrites a
//     fold input. The flush re-reads the door cell (stable until its
//     credit returns) and skips the kernel's own claims in the scan
//     meanwhile — a re-presented claim would steal the shared CAS from a
//     fresh doorbell in the same warp, forever.
//
// THE KERNEL IS A COOPERATIVE GRID: kBulkBlocks blocks,
// co-resident by the cooperative-launch contract, with grid barriers
// between staging | claims | consume rounds | acks. Everything that scales
// with bytes — the outbound staging, the RS fold, the AG landing — runs
// over the whole grid in 16 KB tiles of 16-byte vectors; the claim loop
// and the ack flush stay in block 0. The placement proof (the payload
// folds to its door's hash before any consumption counts) moved from the
// claim into the consume pass: every tile hashes the words it reads, the
// per-(peer, stripe) totals combine by atomic XOR in BusBulkScratch, and
// block 0 proves each stripe between rounds — a stripe read before its
// placement was fully visible is re-folded next round (the fold and the
// copy are pure functions of their inputs); no ack and no done stamp
// until every consumed stripe has proved. The single-block kernel before
// it moved every byte through 256 threads: a 2 MB fold cost 1.4 ms.
// The staging tiles also compute each outbound stripe's fold — the hash
// the door carries — and block 0 publishes the per-(peer, stripe) table
// (`staged_hashes`, pinned, after the staged counters) before releasing
// the counters; the engine posts from it instead of hashing 256 KB per
