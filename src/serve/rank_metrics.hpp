// Per-rank metrics: what each rank of a world measures of its own work.
//
// Rank 0's /metrics/prometheus describes the service — requests, tokens,
// latencies — once for the whole world. The ranks execute every step
// together, but each spends its own time in it: its decode steps and
// prefills include the collectives it waited on, so a rank whose step time
// runs ahead of the others is the slow one (a throttled GPU, a congested
// link). The dgpp_rank_* families report that per rank, labeled `rank`.
// Rank 0 appends them to its exposition; a peer, which serves no HTTP API,
// serves them on its own metrics listener (`ports.metrics`, on its node
// address) when one is configured.
//
// The collective bus's per-lane traffic counters are updated outside its
// stats lock, so they are not read here; the completion epoch is atomic and
// is.
