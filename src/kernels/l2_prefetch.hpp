// kernels, and whenever the chain sits in a latency-bound phase — the bus
// all-reduce, the KDA recurrence, the DSA select/absorb, the router's
// top-k — the memory system idles. Weights, unlike routed experts, are
// known in advance, so a low-priority side stream reads the NEXT kernels'
// bytes into L2 (24 MB on the GB10) while the chain waits; the consuming
// GEMV then hits L2 for that prefix. Pure performance: nothing the model
// reads is written, so every result is bit-identical with it on or off.
//
// Capture-safe: the side stream forks from and joins the main stream
// through events, which under stream capture become graph edges.

// at 240 GB/s is 12 us of queue), which stalls the bus engine's posts and
