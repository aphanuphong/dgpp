// The streaming tensor-core decode GEMM (2026-09-14, the batched decode's
// dense projections and the lm head): out[m, n] = act[m, k] x W[n, k]^T for
// m <= 32 activation rows, the weights read ONCE whatever m.
//
// WHY: the decode GEMV cores (fp8_gemv.cuh, bf16_gemv.cu) chunk the rows by
// four and pay kRows FMAs per weight element on the CUDA cores, so past a
// few rows a projection is issue-bound (the six-slot DeepSeek-V4.1 batch:
// 30 rows = eight chunks, 56 ms of a 249 ms step in dense fp8 projections
// and 18 ms in the 331 MB head). This kernel keeps the GEMV's memory shape
// — one warp per eight weight rows, a quad of lanes per row, 16-byte chunks,
// eight in flight per lane, no barrier in the k loop — and applies every
// chunk to all m rows with mma.sync m16n8k16 (bf16 in, fp32 accumulate):
// the per-weight cost is a dequant, a fixed in-quad shuffle and a quarter
// of an mma, whatever m.
//
// NUMERICS: the weight VALUES are the dequant bridge's (bf16(e4m3 x scale),
// exact for the e8m0 scales); the activations are the bf16 rows as given;
// the fp32 accumulation is the mma's over the k16 slices in ascending k
// order — deterministic, and without split-K the SAME chain whatever m
// (a padded row never touches another row's accumulators), so a batched row is
// bitwise the row alone at m = 1 through this kernel. It is not bitwise
// the GEMV cores' chain (a different fp32 order, inside the oracle budgets).
// With workspace, launches of at most kMmaGemvSplitRows (64, the decode
// batch bound) may use split-K: the split count is a function of the
// shape, the split ranges are 256-k units (a window boundary of every
// tile form), and the 33..64-row form splits like the 1..32-row forms —
// so a row's chain is the same at every decode row count 1..64, split or
// not (2026-10-05: a request's rows in an eight-slot batch are bitwise its
// rows alone). Above 64 rows (the prefill-sized groups) the launch runs
// unsplit, a different chain from the split one.
//
// CONTRACT: m >= 1 (rows 1..128 in one launch — 1/2/4/8 sixteen-row tiles
// by the count — and wider m in 128-row groups, each group its own launch
// re-reading the weights); k % 64 == 0 (a quad of lanes loads 4 x 16 k; a chunk lies inside one scale block:
// cs >= 4); 16-byte-aligned weight rows; act rows 16-byte aligned with an
// even-16-byte stride; out row stride >= n. fp8: w [n, k] e4m3 with block
// scales f32 [ceil(n / 2^rs), ceil(k / 2^cs)]. bf16: w [n, k] bf16.
